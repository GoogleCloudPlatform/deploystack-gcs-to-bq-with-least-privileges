# Spinning up a foundation data pipeline on Google Cloud using Cloud Storage, Dataflow and BigQuery

## Introduction

This repository contains the necessary Terraform modules to securely deploy a basic ETL pipeline that will dump data from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket to tables in BigQuery.

An ETL pipeline is defined in three steps:

* Extraction: retrieving data from sources.
* Transformation: cleaning the data, putting it into a common format, calculating other fields, taking out duplicates or erroneous records so it can be stored into a target.
* Loading: inserting the formatted data into the target database, data store, data warehouse or data lake.

You can learn more about cloud-based ETL [here](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-etl).

## Use cases

Whether you’re transferring from another Cloud Service Provider or you’re taking your first steps into the cloud with Google Cloud, building a data pipeline sets a good foundation to begin deriving insights for your business.

* __Anomaly Detection__: building data pipelines to identify cyber security threats or fraudulent transactions using machine learning (ML) models.
* __Interactive Data Analysis__: carry out interactive data analysis with BigQuery BI Engine that enables you to analyze large and complex datasets interactively with sub-second query response time and high concurrency.
* __Predictive Forecasting__: building solid pipelines to capture real-time data for ML modeling and using it as a forecasting engine for situations ranging from weather predictions to market forecasting.
* __Create Machine Learning models__: using BigQueryML you can create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using standard SQL queries. Create a variety of models pre-built into BigQuery that you train with your data.

## Architecture

![GCS to BigQuery High-level diagram](diagram.png "GCS to BigQuery High-level diagram")

The main components that we would be setting up are (to learn more about these products, click on the hyperlinks):

* [Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/): data lake solution to store extracted raw data that must undergo some kind of transformation.
* [Cloud Dataflow pipeline](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow): to build fully managed batch and streaming pipelines to transform data stored in GCS buckets ready for processing in the Data Warehouse using Apache Beam.
* [BigQuery datasets and tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery): to store the transformed data in and query it using SQL, use it to make reports or begin training [machine learning](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/introduction) models without having to take your data out.
* [Service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) (__created with least privilege on each resource__): one for uploading data into the GCS bucket, one for Orchestration, one for Dataflow instances and one for the BigQuery tables. You can also configure users or groups of users to assign them a viewer role on the created resources and the ability to impersonate service accounts to test the Dataflow pipelines before automating them with a tool like [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer).

For a full list of the resources that will be created, please refer to the [github repository](https://github.com/googlestaging/deploystack-gcs-to-bq-with-least-privileges) for this project. If you're migrating from another Cloud Provider, refer to [this](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/aws-azure-gcp-service-comparison) documentation to see equivalent services and comparisons in Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services

## Costs

Pricing Estimates - We have created a sample estimate based on some usage we see from new startups looking to scale. This estimate would give you an idea of how much this deployment would essentially cost per month at this scale and you extend it to the scale you further prefer. Here's the [link](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator#id=44710202-c9d4-49d5-a378-99d7dd34f5e2).

## Setup

This solution assumes you already have a project created and set up where you wish to host these resources. If not, and you would like for the project to create a new project as well,  please refer to the [github repository](https://github.com/googlestaging/deploystack-gcs-to-bq-with-least-privileges) for instructions.

### Prerequisites

* Have an [organization](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization) set up in Google cloud.
* Have a [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account) set up.
* Have an existing [project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) with [billing enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project), we’ll call this the __service project__.

### Roles & Permissions

In order to spin up this architecture, you will need to be a user with the “__Project owner__” [IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) role on the existing project:

__Note__: To grant a user a role, take a look at the [Granting and Revoking Access](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role) documentation.

### Spinning up the architecture

Before we deploy the architecture, you will need the following information:

* The __service project ID__.
* A __unique prefix__ that you want all the deployed resources to have (for example: awesomestartup). This must be a string with no spaces or tabs.
* A __list of Groups or Users__ with Service Account Token creator role on Service Accounts in IAM format, eg 'group:group@domain.com'.

Click on the button below, sign in if required and when the prompt appears, click on “confirm”. It will walk you through setting up your architecture.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://shell.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGoogleCloudPlatform%2Fdeploystack-gcs-to-bq-with-least-privileges&cloudshell_image=gcr.io%2Fds-artifacts-cloudshell%2Fdeploystack_custom_image&cloudshell_git_branch=main)

This is the startup screen that appears after clicking the button and confirming:

<h4>🎉 Congratulations! 🎉  <br />
You have successfully deployed the foundation for running your first ETL pipeline on Google Cloud.</h4></center>

### Testing your architecture

For the purpose of demonstrating how the ETL pipeline flow works, we’ve set up an example pipeline for you to run.  First of all, we assume all the steps are run using a user listed on the __data_eng_principles__ variable (or a user that belongs to one of the groups you specified). Authenticate the user using the following command and make sure your active cloudshell session is set to the __service project__:

        gcloud auth application-default login

Follow the instructions in the cloudshell to authenticate the user.

To make the next steps easier, create two environment variables with the service project id and the prefix:

        export SERVICE_PROJECT_ID=[SERVICE_PROJECT_ID]
        export PREFIX=[PREFIX]

Again, make sure you’re in the following directory:

        cloudshell_open/cloud-foundation-fabric/blueprints/data-solutions/gcs-to-bq-with-least-privileges

For the purpose of the example we will import a CSV file from GCS to BigQuery. This has the following structure:

        name,surname,timestamp

We need to create 3 files:

* A person.csv file containing your data in the form name,surname,timestamp.  For example: `Eva,Rivarola,1637771951'.
* A person_udf.js containing the [UDF javascript file](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions) used by the Dataflow template.
* A person_schema.json file containing the table schema used to import the CSV.

An example of those files can be found  in the folder ./data-demo inside the same repository you're currently in.

You can copy the example files into the GCS bucket by running:

        gsutil -i gcs-landing@$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com cp data-demo/* gs://$PREFIX-data

Once this is done, the three files necessary to run the Dataflow Job will have been copied to the GCS bucket that was created along with the resources.

Run the following command to start the dataflow job:

        gcloud --impersonate-service-account=orchestrator@$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com dataflow jobs run test_batch_01 \
    --gcs-location gs://dataflow-templates/latest/GCS_Text_to_BigQuery \
    --project $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID \
    --region europe-west1 \
    --disable-public-ips \
    --subnetwork https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID/regions/europe-west1/subnetworks/subnet \
    --staging-location gs://$PREFIX-df-tmp\
    --service-account-email df-loading@$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --parameters \
    javascriptTextTransformFunctionName=transform,\
    JSONPath=gs://$PREFIX-data/person_schema.json,\
    javascriptTextTransformGcsPath=gs://$PREFIX-data/person_udf.js,\
    inputFilePattern=gs://$PREFIX-data/person.csv,\
    outputTable=$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID:datalake.person,\
    bigQueryLoadingTemporaryDirectory=gs://$PREFIX-df-tmp

This command will start a Dataflow job called test_batch_01 that uses a Dataflow transformation script stored in the public GCS bucket:

        gs://dataflow-templates/latest/GCS_Text_to_BigQuery.

The expected output is the following:

![second_output](second_output.png)

Then, if you navigate to Dataflow on the console, you will see the following:

![dataflow_console](dataflow_console.png)

This shows the job you started from the cloudshell is currently running in Dataflow.
If you click on the job name, you can see the job graph created and how every step of the Dataflow pipeline is moving along:

![dataflow_execution](dataflow_execution.png)

Once the job completes, you can navigate to BigQuery in the console and under __SERVICE_PROJECT_ID__ → datalake → person, you can see the data that was successfully imported into BigQuery through the Dataflow job.

## Cleaning up your environment

The easiest way to remove all the deployed resources is to run the following command in Cloud Shell:

``` {shell}
deploystack uninstall
```

The above command will delete the associated resources so there will be no billable charges made afterwards.

Note: This will also destroy the BigQuery dataset as the following option in `main.tf` is set to `true`: `delete_contents_on_destroy`.

## Standalone deployment

Since the scripts are based on Terraform, it is possible to deploy this solution through `Terraform` directly, without having to go through `Deploystack`.
Just clone this repo, create a `terraform.tfvars` file with your own values and call the following commands:
``` {shell}
terraform init
terraform plan -out=execplan.out
terraform apply execplan.out
```
